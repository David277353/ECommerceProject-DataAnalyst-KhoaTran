# 🛒 E-Commerce Data Analytics — Google Analytics Sample Dataset

SQL and BigQuery analysis of Google Analytics session data to uncover revenue trends, user behavior, and product insights across a real-world e-commerce dataset.

---

## 🧩 The Business Problem

Raw Google Analytics data contains millions of rows of session, traffic, and transaction data — but on its own it doesn't answer the questions that actually drive decisions:

- **Which traffic sources are generating revenue, not just visits?**
- **Are users who bounce costing us more than users who convert?**
- **What products do customers buy together — and how can we use that to bundle smarter?**

This project works through those questions systematically using BigQuery SQL on Google's public GA360 dataset.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Google BigQuery** | Cloud SQL database and query engine |
| **SQL (BigQuery dialect)** | All analysis and data transformation |
| **Dataset** | `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample` |

> 💡 No setup or data loading needed — the dataset is publicly available in BigQuery. See **How to Run** below.

## 📊 Analysis Covered

| # | Business Question | SQL Technique |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Total visits, pageviews & transactions (Jan–Mar 2017) | Aggregation, DATE parsing |
| Q2 | Bounce rate by traffic source (Jul 2017) | Aggregation, ratio calculation |
| Q3 | Revenue by traffic source — weekly & monthly (Jun 2017) | CTE, UNION ALL |
| Q4 | Conversion rate by traffic source (2017) | Aggregation, HAVING |
| Q5 | Avg pageviews: purchasers vs non-purchasers (Jun–Jul 2017) | CTE, FULL JOIN |
| Q6 | Avg transactions per user (Jul 2017) | Aggregation |
| Q7 | Revenue contribution by device category (2017) | Window Function, ratio |
| Q8 | Co-purchase analysis — "YouTube Men's Vintage Henley" (Jul 2017) | CTE, JOIN, UNNEST |
| Q10 | Weekly revenue & cumulative revenue (May–Jul 2017) | Window Function, SUM OVER |

## ✨ Key Technical Highlights

- **Cumulative Revenue Tracking** using `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY week)` window functions to monitor business pacing over time. Tracked revenue across 14 weeks (May–Jul 2017), reaching **$240K+ in cumulative revenue** by the end of the period.
- **Co-purchase / Product Affinity Analysis** to identify cross-selling opportunities for product bundling strategies. Among customers who purchased the "YouTube Men's Vintage Henley," **Google Sunglasses** was the top co-purchased item (20 units — nearly 3x the next closest product), surfacing a concrete bundling recommendation for marketing.
- **UNNEST operations** on nested `hits` and `product` arrays within the BigQuery GA schema to handle complex repeated fields.
- Multiple approaches shown per query (CTE, subquery, window functions) with inline notes on trade-offs and best practices.

## 💡 Key Findings

- Traffic sources varied significantly in conversion rate — high-visit sources did not always correlate with high revenue, suggesting budget reallocation opportunities
- Purchasers averaged significantly more pageviews than non-purchasers — indicating engagement depth as a leading indicator of conversion
- Co-purchase analysis revealed clear product affinity patterns that could inform bundling and upsell strategies
- Cumulative revenue tracking showed uneven weekly pacing — useful for forecasting and identifying promotional timing opportunities

## ✅ Business Recommendations

1. **Reallocate marketing spend** toward traffic sources with the highest conversion rate, not just highest visit volume
2. **Use pageview depth as a retargeting signal** — users who browse extensively but don't convert are high-value remarketing targets
3. **Build product bundles** around the co-purchase pairs identified in Q8 — these have proven purchase affinity
4. **Monitor cumulative revenue weekly** against period targets to catch pacing issues early enough to act
